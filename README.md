# Rust Tracing - Ray Tracing in a weekend, but in Rust

I wanted to learn Rust and needed a decent project to learn the basics. And since I wanted to do also the [Ray Tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html), I thought this would be a nice way to learn all basics like defining modules, working with structs, especially with the borrow-checker, etc.
